## 🚀 Project Overview

**Guide of Beers** is a modern, responsive web application designed for beer enthusiasts who want to explore detailed, organized information about breweries, beer styles, and related data.

The project allows users to:

- Browse organized lists of breweries and individual beer styles.
- Access full style descriptions and see beers offered by each brewery.

Its primary value lies in delivering a clean, accessible, and highly usable interface across **desktop, tablet, and mobile devices**, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for all users.

## 🤔 About The Project

This project was developed as part of my ongoing journey transitioning into **front-end development** after several years working in the digital sector.

It was created as a key deliverable for the **Formação.DEV** program, where I’m currently studying full-time to deepen my technical skills and build a strong, practical portfolio.

The main goal of this project was to apply and strengthen my knowledge of **React, SvelteKit, and TailwindCSS**, with a specific focus on **robust responsive design principles** and **accessibility requirements**. This iteration demonstrates a significant upgrade in handling various screen sizes, including the implementation of a versatile mobile navigation (sidebar drawer/hamburger menu).

With a background in **web development (WordPress), technical SEO, and digital project management**, I combine fresh technical skills with a solid understanding of how design, functionality, and performance work together in real-world web environments.

**Key takeaways from this project:**

- Successfully implemented a fully **responsive architecture** (desktop menu vs. mobile hamburger/sidebar).
- Addressed and implemented **Svelte accessibility requirements** for improved usability.
- Reinforced proficiency in SvelteKit component lifecycle and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
- Continued building a portfolio that reflects both dedicated learning and technical evolution.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Fully Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Dedicated sidebar menu for desktop and a touch-friendly hamburger menu/drawer for smaller screens.
- **Detailed Search:** Fast and efficient filtering for breweries and beer styles.
- **Structured Data Display:** Clear presentation of brewery information and associated beer styles.
- **Accessibility Focus:** Developed with attention to Svelte's accessibility best practices.
