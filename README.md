## Project Overview

**Guide of Beers** is a modern and responsive web application designed for beer enthusiasts who want to explore detailed information about breweries, beer styles, and beer data.

The project allows users to browse organized brewery lists, access full beer styles, and see some beers offered by each brewery.

It also provides a fast and efficient search experience, enabling users to quickly find specific information about breweries or beer styles.

## 🤔 About the Project

This project was developed as part of my ongoing journey transitioning into **front-end development** after several years working in the digital sector.

It was created as a deliverable for the **Formação.DEV**, where I’m currently studying full-time to deepen my technical skills and build a strong, practical portfolio.

The main goal of this project was to apply and strengthen my knowledge of **React, SvelteKit, TailwindCSS**.  
It represents my commitment to learning through hands-on experience and delivering clean, functional, and user-focused applications.

With a background in **web development (WordPress), technical SEO, and digital project management**, I combine fresh technical skills with a solid understanding of how design, functionality, and performance work together in real-world web environments.

**Key takeaways:**

- Applied modern front-end technologies in a real project context.
- Reinforced problem-solving and UI implementation skills.
- Continued building a portfolio that reflects both learning and technical evolution.
